Tiger's eye is a chatoyant variety of quartz formed by the pseudomorphous replacement of crocidolite (blue asbestos) by silica. The parallel fibers of the original crocidolite are preserved, giving the stone its characteristic silky luster and the shimmering band of light known as chatoyancy — the "cat's eye" effect.

The golden-brown color results from iron oxide staining of the original blue crocidolite fibers. Unaltered specimens retain blue color and are known as hawk's eye. Tiger's eye is primarily sourced from South Africa and Western Australia.
