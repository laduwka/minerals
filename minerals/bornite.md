Bornite is a copper iron sulfide mineral commonly known as "peacock ore" for its vivid iridescent tarnish in shades of purple, blue, and gold. Fresh surfaces are copper-brown with a metallic luster, but rapid oxidation produces the characteristic colorful patina.

Bornite is an important copper ore mineral, often found alongside chalcopyrite, chalcocite, and other copper sulfides in porphyry copper deposits and hydrothermal veins.
