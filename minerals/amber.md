Amber is fossilized tree resin that has been hardened over millions of years through polymerization. While not a true mineral, it is widely collected and valued for its warm color, light weight, and occasional inclusions of ancient insects or plant material.

Amber is typically translucent to transparent with a characteristic resinous luster. It is very soft (Mohs 2–2.5) and warm to the touch. When rubbed, it develops a static charge — the ancient Greek word for amber, *elektron*, is the origin of the word "electricity."
