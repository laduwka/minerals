Brucite is a magnesium hydroxide mineral that forms in metamorphosed limestones and dolomites, as well as in serpentinites. It typically occurs as tabular crystals, foliated masses, or fibrous aggregates.

Brucite is relatively soft (Mohs 2.5) with a pearly to waxy luster. Colors range from white and colorless to pale green, blue, or yellow depending on trace impurities. It is an important industrial source of magnesium and is used as a flame retardant.
