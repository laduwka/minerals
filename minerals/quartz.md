Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in Earth's continental crust, after feldspar. It is composed of silicon and oxygen atoms in a continuous framework of SiO₄ tetrahedra, with each oxygen shared between two tetrahedra.

Quartz occurs in virtually every geological environment and is a component of almost every rock type. It is especially common in sedimentary, metamorphic, and felsic igneous rocks. Varieties include amethyst (purple), citrine (yellow), rose quartz (pink), smoky quartz (brown-gray), and milky quartz (white).

This specimen is a clear prismatic crystal from Ontario, Canada, displaying typical hexagonal prism termination and vitreous luster.
