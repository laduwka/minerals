Labradorite is a plagioclase feldspar mineral famous for its labradorescence — a vivid play of iridescent colors (blue, green, gold, orange) that appears as the stone is turned. This optical effect is caused by light scattering from lamellar intergrowths within the crystal.

The mineral was first described from specimens found on the Isle of Paul, near Nain, Labrador, Canada. It is a common component of mafic igneous rocks such as basalt and gabbro. Gem-quality labradorite is prized for jewelry and decorative use.
