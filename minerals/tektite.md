Tektites are natural glass objects formed by the melting and rapid cooling of terrestrial rock during meteorite impacts. They are ejected from the impact site and solidify during flight, producing characteristic aerodynamic shapes — teardrops, dumbbells, discs, and irregular splash forms.

Tektites are found in geographically restricted areas called strewn fields, each associated with a specific impact event. Major strewn fields include the Australasian (Southeast Asia, ~0.8 Ma), the Ivory Coast (West Africa, ~1.1 Ma), and the Central European (moldavites, ~15 Ma). Unlike volcanic glass, tektites have very low water content and lack crystalline inclusions.
