Fluorite is a calcium fluoride mineral known for its wide range of colors and well-formed cubic or octahedral crystals. It is the defining mineral for hardness 4 on the Mohs scale and the original mineral in which the phenomenon of fluorescence was described — the word "fluorescence" derives from fluorite.

Colors are caused by various trace impurities and radiation damage to the crystal lattice. Purple and green are the most common, but fluorite also occurs in blue, yellow, colorless, pink, and multicolored banded forms. Many specimens fluoresce blue-violet under ultraviolet light.
