Malachite is a copper carbonate hydroxide mineral with a vivid green color. It has been used as a pigment and ornamental stone for thousands of years. The mineral forms in the oxidation zone of copper ore deposits, where it often occurs alongside azurite, chrysocolla, and native copper.

Malachite is known for its striking banded patterns in light and dark green, visible when the mineral is cut and polished. It typically forms botryoidal, fibrous, or stalactitic masses rather than well-defined crystals.

This specimen from the Katanga province (DR Congo) displays classic botryoidal habit with concentric banding in various shades of green.
