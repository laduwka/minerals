Aventurine is a variety of quartz characterized by its translucency and the shimmering effect known as aventurescence. This optical phenomenon is caused by platy mineral inclusions — most commonly green fuchsite mica, which gives the characteristic green color.

Other colors of aventurine exist (orange, yellow, blue), caused by different included minerals. Green aventurine is the most common and widely collected variety.
