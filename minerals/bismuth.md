Bismuth is a native element that forms striking hopper crystals with a characteristic staircase geometry. The iridescent colors on the surface are a thin oxide layer — the thickness of the oxide determines the color, similar to thin-film interference.

Lab-grown bismuth crystals are popular among collectors for their geometric beauty and vivid rainbow tarnish. Natural bismuth crystals are rare and typically less colorful. Bismuth is one of the least toxic heavy metals and is used in various pharmaceutical and cosmetic products.
