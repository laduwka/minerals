Gypsum is a soft calcium sulfate dihydrate mineral (Mohs 2) that forms in evaporite deposits. It is one of the most common sulfate minerals and has been used for thousands of years in plaster and construction.

Selenite is the transparent, crystalline variety of gypsum, often forming tabular or prismatic crystals with a pearly luster. The name comes from the Greek *selene* (moon), referring to its pale, moonlight-like glow.

Desert rose is a rosette-shaped gypsum formation that develops in arid, sandy environments. Sand grains become incorporated as the crystal grows, creating flower-like clusters with a sandy surface texture.
