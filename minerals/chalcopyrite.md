Chalcopyrite is the most important copper ore mineral and one of the most common sulfides. It has a brass-yellow color similar to pyrite but is distinguished by its lower hardness (3.5 vs 6), deeper yellow tone, and tendency to develop an iridescent tarnish.

Chalcopyrite crystallizes in the tetragonal system, often forming disphenoidal crystals that can resemble tetrahedra. It is found in virtually all types of sulfide ore deposits — porphyry copper, hydrothermal veins, volcanogenic massive sulfide, and sedimentary copper deposits.
