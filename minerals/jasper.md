Jasper is an opaque, microcrystalline variety of quartz (chalcedony) that owes its color and patterns to mineral impurities, particularly iron oxides. It occurs in virtually every color and forms in sedimentary, metamorphic, and volcanic environments.

Brecciated jasper displays a fragmented, angular pattern resulting from natural fracturing and re-cementation by silica-rich fluids. The broken pieces are typically red to brown, bound by contrasting matrix material.

Dalmatian jasper (also called dalmatian stone) is a pale cream-colored stone with dark spots resembling the coat of a dalmatian dog. The dark spots are typically inclusions of tourmaline or other iron-rich minerals.
