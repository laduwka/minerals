Agate is a banded variety of chalcedony, a microcrystalline form of quartz. It forms in volcanic and metamorphic rocks, typically filling cavities in the host rock with concentric layers of silica deposited from groundwater.

Agates are distinguished by their fine banding, which results from rhythmic crystallization. Colors vary widely depending on trace elements and impurities. Tree agate is a dendritic variety featuring green moss-like inclusions of iron or manganese oxides in a white translucent matrix.
