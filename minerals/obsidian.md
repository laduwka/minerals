Obsidian is a naturally occurring volcanic glass formed when felsic lava cools rapidly with minimal crystal growth. It is not a true mineral but a mineraloid — an amorphous solid without a crystalline structure.

Obsidian is characterized by its conchoidal fracture, producing sharp edges that were exploited by prehistoric peoples for tools and weapons. The most common color is black, caused by magnetite nanoinclusions, though snowflake obsidian (with cristobalite inclusions), mahogany obsidian (with iron oxide patterns), and rainbow obsidian (with thin-film iridescence) also occur.
