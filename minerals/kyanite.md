Kyanite is an aluminum silicate mineral remarkable for its directional hardness — it measures 4.5 along the length of its bladed crystals and 7 across them. This property, called anisotropy, is more pronounced in kyanite than in almost any other mineral.

Kyanite typically forms elongated, bladed crystals in blue, though it also occurs in green, orange, and black. It is a metamorphic mineral that forms under high-pressure conditions, and is a key indicator mineral in petrology. Kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite share the same chemical formula (Al₂SiO₅) but crystallize under different pressure-temperature conditions.
