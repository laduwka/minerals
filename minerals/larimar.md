Larimar is a rare blue variety of the mineral pectolite, found only in the Dominican Republic. Its distinctive blue color is attributed to the substitution of cobalt for calcium in the crystal structure.

Larimar ranges from white and light blue to deep volcanic blue, often with white streaks or patterns. It forms in cavities within volcanic basalt flows in the Barahona province. The name "larimar" was coined by combining "Larissa" (the discoverer's daughter's name) and "mar" (Spanish for sea), reflecting its ocean-like color.
