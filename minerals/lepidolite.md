Lepidolite is a lithium-bearing mica mineral with a distinctive lilac to purple color. It is the most common lithium-bearing mineral and an important ore of lithium. The name derives from the Greek *lepidos* (scale), referring to its scaly, micaceous habit.

Lepidolite typically forms as fine-grained, scaly or platy aggregates, though tabular crystals also occur. It is found in lithium-rich granitic pegmatites, often associated with tourmaline, spodumene, and other lithium minerals.
